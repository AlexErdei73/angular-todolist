# Todolist
This is the Angular version of the ToDoList project from the Odin project. It was surprisingly easy
to make this project with Angular, compared to the vanilla JavaScript solution. The explanation is that
the frontend framework can simplify tremendiously the handling of the view. The application logic can be
very complex in vanialla JavaScript regarding the DOM manipulations, as we can see it from this example. 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
